\section*{Abstract}


Comparative risk assessments to quantify the health potential
of active transportation, e.g., walking and cycling, have been
performed in the United States on a limited basis. Current
methodologies, which rely on extensive data collection and user
expertise, have estimated health benefits for select metropolitan
areas under a few alternative scenarios. These analyses have largely
been conducted using the Integrated Transport Health Impacts Model
(ITHIM) which was developed in the UK and has been adapted for use in
the US, primarily California. Here we present an implementation of the
active transportation component of ITHIM to model the health impacts
of modified active transportation levels. Using the newly developed
software package \package{} written in R, along with publicly
available national datasets, we quantify the change in disability
adjusted life years over a wide range of scenarios.  The R package
implemention of ITHIM's physical activity component provides a robust
environment for exploring the relationship between active
transportation and positive health outcomes.  A web-based
user-interface is available for users who want a first estimate for
the impact active transportation has on their
state/region.

\section*{Introduction}

Regular exercise has been shown to provide health benefits in terms of
chronic disease prevention \cite{warburton2006}, cognitive function
\cite{hillman2008}, and overall well being and satisfaction with life
\cite{maher2013}. Still only half of Americans obtain the recommended
levels of aerobic activity of 2.5 hours per week. There is
considerable variability in the attainment of this goal by location
within the country. Supportive local built and policy environments are
important determinants of population-level activity
patterns. Particularly, as they facilitate and foster routine and
moderate physical activity, such as walking, local decisions on design
and policy can play a huge role in improving the nation's health.

Given the constraints and complexity of local governance and
infrastructure investments, land use, and human behavior there is a
need for high quality and reliable data and tools for decision-making
related to urban transportaiton systems. The lack of accurate and
availbale estimates of the health impacts of such decisions has
limited the effectiveness of efforts to encourage non-motorized
transport in the US and in other countries. In the last decade new
tools, applying comparative risk assessment methodologies, have made
progress toward quantifying the multple health impacts of changes to
the transportation system and behaviors.

ITHIM is one such statistical model that integrates data on active
transport, physical activity, fine particulate matter and greenhouse
gas emissions to provide estimates for the proportional change in
mortality and morbidity for given baseline and alternate travel
scenarios. The model has been used to calculate the health impacts of
walking and bicycling short distances usually traveled by car or
driving low-emission automobiles \cite{woodcock2013,maizlish2013}.

ITHIM uses a comparative risk assessment framework for the active
transport component of the model.  We improve on the existing
implementation of the active transport component by including the
distribution of non-travel-related activity, improving numerical
precision when computing the population attributable fraction and
creating a simple user-interface for the custom-built \R{} package
\package{}.  We present this implementation here by using it to
estimate the relationship between overall, nationwide disease burden
and active transportation time in the United States.

\section*{Materials and Methods}


As with the original ITHIM implementation we, employed a comparative
risk assessment (CRA) across scenarios defined by mean active
transportation time, i.e., combined walking and cycling.  To do so we
investigate the proportional change in national disease burden between
the baseline model and a given alternative scenario, i.e., the
population attributable fraction, $\af$.  The population attributable
fraction is defined below and computed for each disease (ICD-10)
included in the model, namely Breast Cancer (C50), Colon Cancer
(C18-C21), Dementia (G30), Diabetes (E10-E14) and Cardiovascular
disease (I10, I12, I15, I20-I25, I30-I31, I33, I40).  We also include
the disability impacts of depression, though it is not listed as a
cause of death in CDC's data. For readability we omit an index
indicating disease.

\begin{equation}
\af_j = \frac{\int \! R_j(x)P(x) \, \mathrm{d}x  - \int \! R_j(x)Q(x) \,
  \mathrm{d}x}{\int \! R_j(x)P(x) \, \mathrm{d}x} \approx 1 - \frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n} R_j(x_i^\prime)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n} R_j(x_i)}  = 1 - \delta_j % = 1 - \frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n} e^{-\alpha \sqrt{x_i^\prime}}}{{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n} e^{-\alpha \sqrt{x_i}}}
  \label{paf}
\end{equation}

Here $R(x)$ represents the risk when the individual has exposure $x$,
physical activity (\mets).  $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ denote the population
density of individuals with exposure $x$, in the baseline and
alternate scenarios, respectively.  The exposure variable, $x$, is
modeled as the sum of two independent random variables, travel-related
and non-travel-related physical activity.  $\mathbf{x}$ and
$\mathbf{x}^\prime$ represent the quantiles for the exposure
distribution in baseline and alternative scenarios, respectively.
$\delta_j$ is the proportional burden for disease $j$ in the alternate
scenario.

\paragraph{Non-Travel-Related Physical Activity}

\begin{equation}
X_{ij}^{\mathrm{non-travel}} \sim \logNormalMath\left(\mu_{ij}, \gamma \mu_{ij}\right)
\end{equation}

Within each age-sex class the non-travel-related exposure is modeled
with a \logNormal{} distribution.  The age-sex specific mean ratios,
$r_{ij} = \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\mu_0}$ and $\gamma$ are estimated from the
American Time Use Survey data \cite{ATUS}.


\paragraph{Travel-Related Physical Activity}

The distribution for travel-related exposure is estimated from the
time spent walking or cycling, i.e., active transport time, which as
in the original ITHIM model is assigned a \logNormal{} distribution
with constant coefficient of variation across age-sex classes.
Travel-related exposure is estimated from active transport time using
assumptions about how much physical activity is required for cycling
and walking.



%To estimate the disease burden we first approximate the population
%attributable fraction through a discretization of the integral in
%equation \ref{paf}.

\paragraph{Non-Travel-Related Physical Activity}

With a simulated distribution for total physical activity in hand we
compute the empirical percentiles in the baseline and alternate
scenarios, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}^\prime$. The proportional
change in disease burden, $\delta$, may be approximated as follows,
where $R$ is the risk function for total activity.

%% \begin{equation}
%% \delta = 1 - \af \approx \frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}} R(x_i)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}} R(x_i^\prime)}
%% \end{equation}


\paragraph{Estimation of Disease Burden}

The disease burden, in this case DALYs, is found for each of the
quantiles using equation \ref{burden} using $B_0$, the overall
nation-wide burden for the baseline.  The overall burden is then
computed as the sum across quintiles, $B=\sum_{j=1}^n B_j$.

\begin{equation}
B_j = \delta B_0\frac{\RR_j}{\sum_{k=1}^n \RR_j}\label{burden}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Risk Functions}

We assign risk based on dose-response curves for each of the diseases
included in the model.

\begin{equation}
\RR_j(x) = \mathrm{e}^{-\alpha_j \tilde{x}}
\end{equation}

where $\tilde{x} = x^k$, $k=\frac{1}{2}$ and $r$ varies by age-sex
class and disease.  For a table of $r$ values see supplementary
material.

\paragraph{Nationwide Health Benefits to Active Transport}

For the purposes of this implementation we limited our analyses to
metropolitan regions of the United States. To idenfity urban
populations we used the National Center for Health Statistics 2013
Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties \cite{ingram2014}. We
eliminated counties in the US with the classifcation of
`nonmetropolitan' (noncore or micropolitan). We used this and similar
classification schemes as well as county and state identifiers in
other datsets (NHTS, ATUS, CDC WONDER) to ensure consistency in our
estimates for input parameters.

To test the new implementation of ITHIM's active transportation
component, we used the US national metro population estimates for
active travel time (walking and cycling) as the baseline. We obtained
active travel time input parameters for alternate scenarios using
states with large sample sizes. From these examples we were able to
approximate low and high active travel scenarios. Finally, we applied
these active travel times to the US metro population to perform the
comparative risk assessment against the baseline US numbers. We then
examined the sensitivity of disease burden estimates to input
parameters including the active travel time and non-travel activity.

\section*{Results}


We report total change (averted or increased) in diability adjusted
life years (DALYs) as an estimate of disease burden change with
alternative scenarios.

To estimate DALYs we use a methodology adopted from previous US
implementations of ITHIM which scale Global Budern of Disease
Estimates for the US to smaller populations using mortality rate
ratios \cite{maizlish2013}. Age, sex, and casuse specific mortalities
were obtained form the CDC WONDER database for US metro counties for
the years 2010-2014. Cells with mortality counts less than 10 deaths
were suppressed for privacy and imputed (0 to 9) using R's random
integer generator.

Our subset of the US population to only metropolitan counties
consisted of 1,090 of 3,141 (34.7\%) counties, or approximately 272M
of 312M (87\%) of the total US population. The age and gender
distribution of our subset population was slightly younger (???making
this up???) than the national population. Baseline active transport
times (walking and cycling) for the US across age and sex groupings
was found to be approximately 43 min/week (???). Baseline non-travel
activity time was found to be ???X??? (min/week) from the ATUS for US
metropolitan populations.

Adapting ITHIM's methods to the R platform enables the rapid and
thorough assessment of parameter influence within the model. Another
important improvement enabled by the shift to a more computationaly
robust platform was to examine methodological assumptions of former
implementations. One critical assumption invovles the approximation of
??? used to calculate the attirbutable fraction (see Figure
\ref{fig:overview}). Previous implementations used quitiles to
approximate this value, essentailly the area under the ???? curve. We
improved upon those methods to use percentiles or 100 points to
estimate the same values. We find our estimates to be much more stable
and reliable at all values of active travel and non-travel activity
parameters.

As exhibited in Figure \ref{fig1}, the variability in disease burden
benefits varies to a much greater degree when using fewer points in
the attirbutable fraction approximation. Importantly, we see greater
stability when using the package and percentiles to approximate
attirbutable fraction.

Comparing baseline to scenarios with increased active travel produced
estimates of up to 360,000??? fewer DALYs (with 300\% increase in mean
active travel time) for our US population subset. We then varied the
mean non-travel activity time and active travel time to observe how
this chaged results (\ref{fig1}). We observe the most dramatic
responses in disease burden estimates to changes in active travel time
when non-travel activity times are lowest. This result is consistent
with the non-linear dose-response curve for physical activity and
several health outcomes.
