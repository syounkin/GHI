Equity

My assumption about how this would be achieved is as follows:

* Estimate the baseline parameters for a pair of subpopulations, e.g., low income and high income
* Construct a scenario for each subpopulation in which there is no active travel at all
* Within each subpopulation compare the baseline to the scenario to estimate reduction in disease burden due to baselin elevels of active transport.
* Compare the estimates of disease burden reduction among the subpopulations.

The result might look something like this.
* "Active transport accounts for x% reduction in disease burden among
high income residents, while among low oncome residents only y%
reduction is achieved."
* "To reverse this we propose the following changes which will increase
y to something closer to x."
* "Our goal is to achieve equity across income groups.  This can be
achieved by making the following changes to the built environment,
which ideally will increase y to x (equity occurs when y = x ?)."
