I plan to purchase airfare for a trip to The Centre for Diet and
Activity Research (CEDAR)

I am writing to request permission to purchase airfare for a trip to
The Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR) at the University of
Cambridge in Cambridge, England.  The purpose of the trip is to
collaborate with Dr. James Woodcock, the creator of the Integrated
Transport and Health Impacts Model (ITHIM), on the implementation of
ITHIM as an R software package.  A few of my goals are to provide
support for converting R scripts written by CEDAR into documented,
shareable pacakges, to enable the use of the ITHIM R package written
by GHI, and to set goals for collaboration on conversion of all ITHIM
modules to R packages.




is studying the factors that influence dietary and physical activity
related behaviours, developing and evaluating public health
interventions, and helping shape public health practice and policy.


CEDAR is one of five Centres of Excellence in Public Health Research
funded through the UK Clinical Research Collaboration, and draws on
the expertise of a wide range of scientific disciplines.

We are a partnership between the University of Cambridge, the
University of East Anglia and MRC Units in Cambridge. We are driven by
the overall goal of supporting effective interventions to change diet
and physical activity behaviours at the population level.
