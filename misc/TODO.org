* Model Input
** Regional Parameters
*** Tw, Tc
**** Simplify
 Replace F, Rws, Rct, Rws and cv with Tw and Tc.  Rws unecessary if we
 treat walking METs like cycling METs and cv as constant or a function
 of something
**** Tw is the mean walking time matrix, likewise with Tc and cycling
 So, it is simply a question of estimating the means per stratum.
*** M
**** A matrix of mean non-travel MET-hrs./week
**** cv is assumed constant
*** D
**** An array of region-specific disease burdens
** Model Parameters
*** RR
**** Relative risk vs. exposure curves
**** This definition will affect the defintion of M
**** Waiting on Woodcock



* Database
** Parameter Collections
*** HHS metro-regions
 We group all metro regions into one for each of ten non-overlapping
 regions (HHS) across the U.S.
**** ITHIM object
 When a parameter is missing we use the national average defined by Jeff at CDC


* Tw, Tc (Sam)
** Average time walking or cycling as transport
** Transportation Survey Data
** Ask Vargo to describe what data we currently have access to.
** Investigate Spak's methods
*** Look like he can get tract, county and MSA data from ACS
**** How does he do that?

* M (Sam)
** Use ATUS data at some regional level
 Is this the same definition of region as with D?

* D (Vargo)
*** Query CDC Wonder to get mortality rates at the HHS regional level

* RR (Vargo)
** Follow up with Woodcock about availability of RR curves
