Preferred:
40.5 -> 53.4 min/week of active transport

Ambitious:
283 min/week of active transport (~4.5 hrs/week)

One hundred fifty minutes of weekly physical activity represents the
U.S. Surgeon General's physical activity recommendation for adults and
corresponds to a level beyond which there are smaller health benefits
per additional minute of physical activity (Physical Activity
Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008).

The above corresponds to approximately 12.5 MET-hrs./week
