Comparative risk assessments to quantify the health potential of active transportation, e.g., walking and cycling, have been performed in the United States on a limited basis. Current methodologies, which rely on significant data collection and user expertise, have estimated health benefits for select metropolitan areas using a few hypothetical scenarios. These analyses have largely been conducted using the Integrated Transport Health Impacts Model (ITHIM) which was developed in the UK and has been adapted for use in the US, primarily California. Here we present an implementation of the active transportation component of ITHIM which models the health impacts of modified active transportation levels. Using the newly developed software package ITHIM written in R, along with publicly available national datasets (U.S.), we quantify the change in disability adjusted life years over a wide range of scenarios.  The R package implemention of ITHIM's physical activity component provides a robust environment for exploring the relationship between active transportation and health outcomes.  A web-based user-interface is available for users who want a first estimate for the impact active transportation has on their state/region. The resulting package for R is freely available online. We believe these improvements will appeal to a larger user base through its ease of use, improved documentation, and more powerful capabilities.
