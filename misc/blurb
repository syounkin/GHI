Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) make decisions on
transportation infrastructure by comparing scenario-based models.  It
is known that a population's transportation habits greatly affect it's
public health, yet health outcomes are not routinely considered by
MPOs during planning.  We seek to quantify the health outcomes
associated with transportation changes, and to support regulations
that encourage changes in infrastructure and policy that promote
global health.  To do so we are in the process of linking the ITHIM
model of Woodcock et al. to the popular simulation software, UrbanSim.

Ralph Nader is responsible for saving thousands of lives due to his
introduction of regulations on the auto industry.  We believe that GHI
will be a similar success story and prevent significant, and costly,
mortality and morbidity nationwide.
